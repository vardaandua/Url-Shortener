# Url-Shortener

A URL shortener is a tool or service that takes a long URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and creates a shorter, more compact version of it.
The shortened URL redirects users to the original, longer URL when clicked. The primary purpose of a URL shortener is to make long URLs more manageable,
shareable, and easier to remember.

URL shorteners are commonly used in situations where character count is limited, such as social media platforms like Twitter, where there is a maximum character 
limit per post. By shortening the URL, users can include more content within the character limit while still providing a clickable link.

## Installation
```bash
npm i package.json
```
### Start
```bash
npm run devStart
```
I have  used an online database on mongodb.com/atlas/database , and used the cluster link of the project online in the server.js file and replacing the password
with that of the user created while making the database.
